1. Created a Kafka topic "test2" with 3 partitions.
2. Implemented a Kafka Producer that produces 1000 messages per second with keys (key1, key2, ..., key10) and random integer values (0-100).
3. Implemented a Kafka Consumer that calculates the average of incoming messages and prints it after every 10,000 messages.
4. Started one instance of the Kafka Producer.
5. Started four instances of the Kafka Consumer.
6. Consumers output the average of consumed messages after every 10,000 records. Each consumer processes a portion of the messages from the topic.
7. Producers and consumers do not print messages at the same frequency due to differences in message production and consumption rates, network latency, and processing overhead.
